      <h3>Dracula</h3>

        <h4>Synopsis</h4>
          <p>
            Dracula begins with a young Solicitor's visit to the obscure Castle of Count Dracula with the object of finalizing the transfer of some London-based properties. What was supposed to be a straightforward business affair soon assumes increasingly terrifying prospects when the seemingly charming and aristocratic Dracula reveals himself to be an evil vampire with intentions of going to London to hunt for fresh blood.

            The main character Dracula arrives in London and wreaks havoc for a while among Jonathan's circle of friends and acquaintances with them being none the wiser to the evil that haunts them, that is until the more knowledgeable Van Helsing comes into the scene. Armed with extensive information about both modern medicine and vampire folklores, Van Helsing assembles the Crew of light for a deadly showdown with the vampire. Utilizing contemporary record-keeping and communication tools as well as the latest advances in medicine while not disregarding more superstitious and spiritual weaponry, the protagonists finally have a fighting chance against the monster threatening their loved ones. The battles are fought from London to Scandinavia, with enormous sacrifices made in the effort to defeat Dracula.

            Abraham Stoker (8 November 1847 - 20 April 1912) was an Irish author who wrote the 1897 Gothic horror novel Dracula. During his lifetime, he was better known as the personal assistant of actor Sir Henry Irving and business manager of the West End's Lyceum Theatre, which Irving owned.

            In his early years, Stoker worked as a theatre critic for an Irish newspaper, and wrote stories as well as commentaries. He also enjoyed travelling, particularly to Cruden Bay in Scotland where he set two of his novels. During another visit to the English coastal town of Whitby, Stoker drew inspiration for writing Dracula. He died on 20 April 1912 due to locomotor ataxia and was cremated in north London. Since his death, his magnum opus Dracula has become one of the best-known works in English literature, and the novel has been adapted for numerous films, short stories, and plays.

          <p>
            The impact of Bram Stoker's Dracula cannot be understated; this is truly one of the most impactful peices of fiction ever told. The story, told through a series of letters, diary enteries, and newspaper clippings, is a masterclass in suspense and horror. The "found footage" esque writing style and method bring the reader a level of intamacy with that characters that I have not seen in a novel before. The setting of misty landscapes, dark gothic castles, and foggy gaslit London streets is so vividly described that the reader can't help but to keep reading. The characters fit into the setting like puzzle peices, and the dynamic between the benevolent Van Helsing and the malicious Count Dracula is incredubly engaging. Dispite the notorious Count only appearing on a handful of pages throughout the novel, he looms ominously over the story to the point where the reader can feel him in every scene. His actions behind the scenes are so sinister and calculated that when he does show his gastly face, the reader feels a sort of contempt towards him, despite the scarcity of his appearances. Although I cannot praise this novel enough, the ending is too abrupt and anticlimactic for me to give it a perfect score.

        <h4>About the Author</h4>
          <p>
            A ghost-writing contest on a stormy June night in 1816 inspired Frankenstein, often called the first true work of science-fiction. Superficially a Gothic novel, influenced by the experiments of Luigi Galvani, it was concerned with the destructive nature of power when allied to wealth. Shelley was 19 when she wrote the novel.

            Familiar to scholars, librarians and the entire literary world, the novel tells the story of Doctor Victor Frankenstein and a creature he creates in an unorthodox scientific experiment. It was an instant wonder and spawned a mythology all of its own that endures to this day.

            After Percy Shelley's death in 1822, Mary Shelley returned to London and pursued a very successful writing career as a novelist, biographer and travel writer. She also edited and promoted her husband's poems and other writings. She died on 1 February 1851.

          <p>
            I have read Frankenstein five times in the last few years. Mary Shelley is one of the greatest storytellers to comment on the human condition. The relationship between Frankenstein and the monster is profound, and the tale of Frankenstein's self inflicted woe is an impactful one. The causionary tale of the dangers of playing God is difficult to pull off, but Frankenstein executes it perfectly. Dispite the monster's murders and terror, he is truly the victim of Frankenstein's youthful hubris.

            9/10 - the wedding night scene is bone-chilling and the monster's monologue is heartbreaking

          <p>
            Going into the story of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, I was already familiar with the premise of the story, but I was still pleasantly surprised. The plot moves incredibly fast, given the length of the novel, which leaves little room for development. The characters are concice and to the point, and the setting is described with a similar brevity. I found the short length of the novel to be a double edged sword; the story is fast paced which keeps the reader constantly engaged and asking what the demonic Mr. Hyde will do next, but the story feels like it ends before it really gets the chance to begin.
