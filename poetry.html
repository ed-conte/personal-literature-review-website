      <h3>The Divine Comedy: The Inferno</h3>

        <h4>Synopsis</h4>
          <p>
            Inferno is the first poem in a three-part series called The Divine Comedy. Inferno is an allegorical journey through Hell. In part, Inferno is a political allegory, and in part it is a religious allegory. It is also a story following the classic elements of a comedy—it starts in the depths of Hell but ends with the joys of Heaven.

            In this epic poem, Dante himself has to travel through the layers of Hell in order to find his dead love, Beatrice, who is watching over him in Heaven. She sends the poet Virgil, who is spending eternity in Limbo, to guide him and help him make his way to her. Dante feels great feelings of pity and is overwhelmed at first, however he seems to come to a deeper understanding of Hell and how it functions as a spiritual realm, so by the end he possesses a certain acceptance and wisdom about Hell and its purpose.

            Dante was instrumental in establishing the literature of Italy, and is considered to be among the country's national poets and the Western world's greatest literary icons.[12] His depictions of Hell, Purgatory and Heaven provided inspiration for the larger body of Western art and literature.[13][14] He influenced English writers such as Geoffrey Chaucer, John Milton, and Alfred Tennyson, among many others. In addition, the first use of the interlocking three-line rhyme scheme, or the terza rima, is attributed to him. He is described as the "father" of the Italian language.

          <p>
            Dante's Inferno is an extremely influencial work of fiction that redefined the way that people view hell in their minds. The imagery and descriptions of the different levels of hell are so gruesome that they stay with the reader well after thay close the back cover. The story of Dante is comical at times as his hypocracy and self insertion is extremely apparent to those who know their history.

            6/10 - the imagery is extremely vivid and the story is entertaining, but the self insertion of the author, although comical, is a bit distracting

      <h3>The Odyssey</h3>

        <h4>Synopsis</h4>
          <p>
            The Odyssey does not follow a linear chronology. The reader begins in the middle of the tale, learning about previous events only through Odysseus's retelling. The first four books set the scene in Ithaca. Penelope, Odysseus's wife, and their young son, Telemachus, are powerless before her arrogant suitors as they despair of Odysseus's return from the siege of Troy. Telemachus is searching for news of his father, who has not been heard from since he left for war nearly 20 years earlier. He journeys secretly to the Peloponnese and seeks out two men who fought with Odysseus in the war at Troy, Nestor and Menelaus, and discovers that his father is indeed still alive.

            The second four books (V-VIII) introduce the main character, Odysseus, as he is being released from captivity by the nymph Calypso on the island of Ogygia. He suffers a shipwreck and lands on the shore of Scheria, the land of the Phaeacians. In Books IX-XII Odysseus tells the Phaeacians of the harrowing journey he and his crew endured as they tried to find their way home—including their encounters with the lotus-eaters, Laestrygonians, and the sorceress Circe, their narrow escape from the cave of the Cyclops Polyphemus, their ordeal navigating between Scylla and Charybdis, and the final shipwreck in which Odysseus is washed ashore on Ogygia alone.

            Finally, Books XIII-XXIV, the second half of the poem, find Odysseus back in Ithaca, facing unexpected obstacles and danger. He meets with his protector-goddess Athena and reveals himself first to his faithful swineherd Eumaeus and then to Telemachus before developing a complicated plan to dispose of the suitors. During Odysseus's absence, Penelope resisted the importuning of more than a hundred suitors—who have stayed in Odysseus's house, eating, drinking, and carousing while waiting for her to decide among them. In order to reunite with his wife, Odysseus kills them all, with the aid of Telemachus, Eumaeus, and Philoetius (a servant and cowherd).

        <h4>About the Author</h4>
          <p>
            Homer's epic poems shaped aspects of ancient Greek culture and education, fostering ideals of heroism, glory, and honor.[6] To Plato, Homer was simply the one who "has taught Greece". In Dante Alighieri's Divine Comedy, Virgil refers to Homer as "Poet sovereign", king of all poets; in the preface to his translation of the Iliad, Alexander Pope acknowledges that Homer has always been considered the "greatest of poets". From antiquity to the present day, Homeric epics have inspired many famous works of literature, music, art, and film.

          <p>
            The Odyssey is a must read for greek myth enthusiests. The story of Odysseus' long journey home after the Trojan War is a classic, albeit lenthy and tedious at times. The story gives wonderful insight into the culture and beliefs of the ancient Greeks, that so drasticlally contrast those of modern society.

      <h3>Beowulf</h3>

        <h4>Synopsis</h4>
          <p>
            Beowulf falls into two parts. It opens in Denmark, where King Hrothgar has a splendid mead hall known as Heorot, a place of celebration and much merriment. However, the joyous noise angers Grendel, an evil monster living in a nearby swamp. For 12 years the creature terrorizes Heorot with nightly visits in which he carries off Hrothgar's warriors and devours them.

            After learning of the Danes' trouble, young Beowulf, a prince of the Geats in what is now southern Sweden, arrives with a small band of retainers and offers to rid Heorot of its monster. Hrothgar is astonished at the little-known hero's daring but welcomes him. After an evening of feasting, much courtesy, and some discourtesy—at one point, one of Hrothgar's men insults Beowulf—the king retires, leaving Beowulf in charge. During the night, Grendel comes from the moors, rips open the heavy doors, and devours one of the sleeping Geats. He then grapples with Beowulf, who refuses to use a weapon. Beowulf grips one of Grendel's hands with such force that the monster finally wrenches himself free only when his arm is torn off at the shoulder. Mortally wounded, Grendel returns to his swamp and dies. Beowulf then displays the monster's arm in Heorot for all to see.

            The next day is one of rejoicing in Heorot, and a feast is thrown in Beowulf's honour. However, as the warriors sleep that night, Grendel's mother, another swamp monster, comes to avenge her son's death, and she kills one of Hrothgar's men. In the morning Beowulf dives into her mere (lake) to search for her, and she attacks him. They struggle in her dry cave at the mere's bottom, and Beowulf finally kills her with a sword. In the cave, Beowulf discovers Grendel's corpse, whose head he cuts off and takes back to Heorot. The Danes rejoice once more. Hrothgar makes a farewell speech about the character of the true hero, and Beowulf, enriched with honours and princely gifts, returns home to King Hygelac of the Geats.

            The second part passes rapidly over Hygelac's subsequent death in a battle (of historical record), the death of his son, and Beowulf's succession to the kingship and his peaceful rule of 50 years. However, the tranquility ends when a fire-breathing dragon becomes enraged after a man steals from its treasure-filled lair. The creature begins ravaging Geatland, and the brave but aging Beowulf decides to engage it, despite knowing that he will likely die. The fight is long and terrible—a painful contrast to the battles of his youth. Painful too is the desertion of all his retainers except for his young kinsman Wiglaf, who comes to his aid. They ultimately kill the venomous dragon, but Beowulf is mortally wounded from a bite in the neck. Before he dies, he names Wiglaf his successor. Beowulf is cremated on a funeral pyre, and his remains are buried in a barrow built by the sea. As his people mourn his death, they also express the fear that, without Beowulf, Geatland will be invaded by nearby tribes.

        <h4>About the Author</h4>
          <p>
            The author of Beowulf is unknown. It is possible that the poem was composed by and transmitted between several different poets before it was preserved in a single manuscript that dates to about 1000.

          <p>
            Beowulf is an interesting epic poem that retains many remnants of the oral tradition that it was initially told in. The christian influence of the scribe that recorded the poem is evident in the text, which unfortunatly overshadows the pagan roots of the story. The masterful interweaving of multiple stories into the poem is a testiment to the skill of the orator that once told the story, and an artifact of a culture that has gone from this world.
