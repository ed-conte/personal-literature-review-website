      <h3>The Count of Monte Cristo</h3>

        <h4>Synopsis</h4>
          <p>
            The story of The Count of Monte Cristo, written by Alexandre Dumas, centers around a protagonist named Edmund Dantes. Dantes becomes wrongfully imprisoned after being framed for a crime he did not commit. Once he becomes free, he assumes the identity of The Count of Monte Cristo, seeking revenge on those responsible for his imprisonment.

            The story begins in 1815 when Dantes is only 19 years old and aboard a ship in trouble. After their captain falls ill, the crew docks on the island of Marseille. While on his death bed, the ship's captain tasks Dantes with delivering a letter to an unknown man in Paris. Danglars and Mondego aboard, who are also aboard the ship, become jealous of Dantes' quick advancement. Once in Paris, the letter is revealed to be addressed to the father of the main prosecutor, Villefort. The three men conspire to frame Dantes as a traitor because they all share the same benefit from Dantes' imprisonment.

            Alexandre Dumas' works have been translated into many languages and he is one of the most widely read French authors. Many of his historical novels of adventure were originally published as serials, including The Count of Monte Cristo, The Three Musketeers, Twenty Years After and The Vicomte of Bragelonne: Ten Years Later. Since the early 20th century, his novels have been adapted into nearly 200 films. Prolific in several genres, Dumas began his career by writing plays, which were successfully produced from the first. He wrote numerous magazine articles and travel books; his published works totalled 100,000 pages. In the 1840s, Dumas founded the Théâtre Historique in Paris.

            The Count of Monte Cristo has been, and will most likely remain, my favorite reading experience of all time. This is one of the most difficult-to-put-down books I have had the pleasure of reading. Dumas' writing style is so incredibly engaging, his characters are dynamic and charismatic, and the revenge plot that unfolds through the novel is so satisfying and carefully executed. Dumas perfectly captures the opulance of the setting in his descriptions of the decor, while the characters are so fleshed out that the reader can see a detailed image of them in their mind.

      <h3>The Three Musketeers</h3>

        <h4>Synopsis</h4>
          <p>
            A historical romance, it relates the adventures of four fictional swashbuckling heroes who lived under the French kings Louis XIII and Louis XIV, who reigned during the 17th and early 18th centuries. At the beginning of the story, D'Artagnan arrives in Paris from Gascony and becomes embroiled in three duels with the three musketeers Athos, Porthos, and Aramis. The four become such close friends that when D'Artagnan serves an apprenticeship as a cadet, which he must do before he can become a musketeer, each of his friends takes turns sharing guard duty with him. The daring escapades of the four comrades are played out against a background of court intrigue involving the powerful cardinal Richelieu.

            Dumas' masterful character developement and witty dialogue are a joy to read in The Three Musketeers, just as they are in The Count of Monte Cristo. The rags to riches plot and determination of the main character, D'Artagnan, are inspiring in the face of the adversity and evil he faces throughout the story. The three musketeers, Athos, Porthos, and Aramis are beautifully crafted characters in their own right; their unique personalities are almost characitures of the aristocratic class in France the time. The dynamacism of the characters, similarly to The Count of Monte Crist, is what makes the characters in this story feel alive. The plot and antagonist are both gripping and keep the reader engaged and on the edge of their seat.

            7/10 - all the greatness of a Dumas story and characters, but it takes a while to get going and drags on during the seige of La Rochelle

        <h4>About the Author</h4>
          <p>
            Francis Scott Key Fitzgerald (September 24, 1896 - December 21, 1940) was an American novelist, essayist, and short story writer. He is best known for his novels depicting the flamboyance and excess of the Jazz Age—a term he popularized in his short story collection Tales of the Jazz Age. During his lifetime, he published four novels, four story collections, and 164 short stories. Although he achieved temporary popular success and fortune in the 1920s, Fitzgerald received critical acclaim only after his death and is now widely regarded as one of the greatest American writers of the 20th century.

          <p>
            The Great Gatsby's depiction of the roaring 20s is an insightful lense to view the time period through. The protagonist, Nick Carraway, is the perfect vessel for the reader to insert themselves into the story; just like the reader, he too is a newcomer to the world we are thrust into. Carraway's interactions with Gatsby throughout the rather short novel are both a driving force to the plot, and a source of character developement for Gatsby, the secret main character. Though I found the plot itself to be somewhat lacking, the symbolism and character interactions are what make this novel stand out to me.

            3/5 - a great window into another time, but the plot is somewhat lacking
