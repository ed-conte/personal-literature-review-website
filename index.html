        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Hello, My name is Edward Conte. I am an undergraduate student at Cornell University. I have been an avid reader since I was a child, and I have been writing my own stories since middle school. I have had a passion for the art of storytelling since I was old enough to understand what a story was, and have the utmost appreciation for them in all of the various forms in which they has been expressed throughout the ages; however books reign supreme. stemming from my interest in history, I have a particular fondness for classic literature, epic poems, gothic horror and fantasy novels.
