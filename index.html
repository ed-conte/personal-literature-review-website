            <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>
                    Hello, My name is Edward Conte. I am an undergraduate student at Cornell University. I have been an avid reader since I was very young, and have been writing my own stories since middle school. The advent of my passion for the art of storytelling began as a child, and persisted until my reading level was advanced enough to truly enjoy the finest literature. I have the utmost appreciation for storytelling in all of its various forms; however books reign supreme. Stemming from my interest in history, I have a particular fondness for the genres of classic literature, epic poetry, gothic horror and medieval fantasy.
