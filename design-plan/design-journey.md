# Project 1: Design Journey

**For each milestone, complete only the sections that are labeled with that milestone.** Refine all sections before the final submission.

You are graded on your design process. If you later need to update your plan, **do not delete the original plan, leave it in place and append your new plan _below_ the original.** Then explain why you are changing your plan. Any time you update your plan, you're documenting your design process!

**Replace ALL _TODOs_ with your work.** (There should be no TODOs in the final submission.)

Be clear and concise in your writing. Bullets points are encouraged.

**Everything, including images, must be visible in _Markdown: Open Preview_.** If it's not visible in the Markdown preview, then we can't grade it. We also can't give you partial credit either. **Please make sure your design journey should is easy to read for the grader;** in Markdown preview the question _and_ answer should have a blank line between them.


## Markdown Instructions

## Personal Site (Milestone 1)

### Website Topic (Milestone 1)

database of lore on Fromsoftware's Dark souls series of video games. These games possess deep complicated pantheons of gods and monsters. Each page will be a different entry in the series with sections for characters, timelines, and landmark events.

## Personal Website Design Exploration (Milestone 1)

Identify three personal websites (preferably static websites) that exist today on the web. You will be drawing inspiration from these sites for your own site; please select websites that are similar to the website you wish to create.

Include a screenshot of the home page for each site. If you're planning a mobile website, your screenshots should be from a mobile website. If you're planning a desktop website, your screenshots should be from a desktop website.

**We'll refer to these are your "example websites."**

### Personal Website 1 Review (Milestone 1)
> This site is designed for young men and women, approximately 13 and up, as that is the game's intended audience. The audience's goals when visiting this site are likely to answer a question relating to the game's story and lore. The game this site explains is vast and has many easy-to-miss characters and storylines. This site has maps, images, art pieces, bodies of text, and timelines. This site addresses the audience's goals by providing a wide range of information regarding the game. The design is relatively simple, and although I am not too fond of the ads and side menu, the information sections are neatly organized in an order that I find convenient. The site is designed for both desktop and mobile devices.


### Personal Website 2 Review (Milestone 1)
> The intended audience of this site is dungeon masters of dungeons and dragons, which tend to be older adolescents, young adults, and adults. When visiting this site, people generally aim to streamline their Dungeons and Dragons campaign. This site makes running the game much more fun for the DM and players. This site includes large images, text, and a large map. The content of this website addresses the goals of the audience. What I like about the design of this site is the main page. It includes a large background image and a prompt to jump right into the campaign manager, while the menu at the top is easily navigatable. This site is designed primarily for desktops, although it does work on mobile.


### Personal Website 3 Review (Milestone 1)
> The intended audience for this site is, once again, young adults. The audience of this site is those looking for guides on gameplay mechanics, story moments, and character quests. This site contains game guides and information regarding the narrative and game lore. This website presents large bodies of information and a plethora of maps detailing in-game locations; the content of this site brings everything from this huge game into one place, addressing the audience's goals; answering any question about the story and lore becomes exceptionally convenient. The menus of this site include icons straight from the game, making navigation easily understandable for the intended audience. The colors and organization are also reminiscent of the in-game menus. This website is designed for both desktop computers and mobile devices.

## Audience & Goals (Milestone 1)

Using what you learned from studying the example websites, identify your website's audience and their goals.

### Audience (Milestone 1)
> The audience for my site would be young adults. Young adults are the primary audience of the games featured on the site. I will target specifically those who wish to explore specifically the narrative, lore, and characters, as I will leave out anything related to gameplay mechanics and guides.

### Audience Goals (Milestone 1)

1. learning about the games' lore to make an educated purchasing descision

2. Finding inspiration for writing and worldbuilding

3. clarifying vague aspects of the game's characters and story


## Content Planning (Milestone 1)

Plan your site's content.

### Your Site's Planned Content (Milestone 1)

- text
- character images
- location images
- artifact images

### Content Justification (Milestone 1)
> A website that provides a surplus of information about such an expansive piece of fiction requires images to accompany the often difficult-to-remember names. An individual may not remember a name, but they may remember the face, artifact, or location it belongs to. On the other hand, a user may want to find a specific character, place, or artifact to look for in a game, and providing an image alongside a name and description helps them achieve their goal more effectively.

### Home Page Content (Milestone 1)
> The homepage will include a text description and a short synopsis of the game world. I will include a large image to associate with the text. When the user enters the site, they should be instantly provided with a brief introduction to know if they are in the right place, and if so, they can be conveniently brought closer to their goal. To some, a brief introduction may be all they need. I will include a menu to navigate the site's various pages, and icons will accompany the labels for a more aesthetically pleasing experience. The menu will be easily read and placed conveniently on the page to provide the user with the most accessible way to find the required information.

## Information Architecture (Milestone 2)

For milestone 2, you will design the information architecture for all the pages your website.

You may change your homepage content based on your card sorting. If you do change the homepage content, don't update it above, just include the new plan in the section below (Content Organization).

### Content Organization (Milestone 2)
> Document your **iterations** of card sorting here. You must have at least 2 iterations of card sorting.
> Include photographic evidence of each iteration of card sorting **and** description of your thought process for each iteration.
> Please physically sort cards; please don't try and do this digitally.

TODO: photos and explanations of each iteration


### Final Content Organization (Milestone 2)
> Which iteration of card sorting will you use for your website?

TODO: tell us which iteration of card sorting you plan to use.

> Explain how the final organization of content is appropriate for your site's audiences.

TODO: why does this organization make sense for your audience (not you)?


### Navigation (Milestone 2)
> Please list the pages you will include in your website's navigation.

- TODO: page 1

- ...

> Explain why the names of these pages make sense for your site's audience.

TODO: explain why the pages name make sense to the audience.


## Visual Themes (Milestone 3)

**Make the case for your decisions using concepts from class, as well as other design principles, theories, examples, and cases from outside of class.**

Remember to focus on the things we can't see just by looking at the site: changes, alternatives considered, processes, and justifications.

Each section is probably around 1 reasonably sized paragraph (2-4 sentences).

### Theme Ideas (Milestone 3)
> Discuss several (more than two) ideas about styling your site's theme. Explain why the theme ideas are appropriate for your target audiences.

TODO: theme ideas

TODO: composition sketches


### Final Site Design (Final Submission)
> Include a sketch of the final composition for each page in your site.
> Provide an explanation below each sketch.

TODO: site sketches


### Static Website Design Check (Final Submission)
> We're building a static website without interactivity.
> **No part of your website may dynamically change.**
> Examples of dynamic behavior are dropdown menus, hamburger menus, popups, modals/lightboxes, image carousels, etc.
>dfd
> Audit your design and check that you aren't relying on any dynamic features.

TODO: Explain why your site's design is completely static.


## Rationale (Final Submission)

**This rationale should be polished writing:** one you might submit as a report to a client or boss to help explain the project and convince them you did a good job. You'll be surprised how much writing and communicating you need to do about projects and choices on internships and jobs; practice that here.

It should be a comprehensive, complete story of the project. You might find that each section runs a few paragraphs (1-2). Sketches can often help tell the story of your design. Screenshots are also useful for describing issues discovered during the design process and how you addressed them.

**All images must be visible in "Markdown: Open Preview" for credit!**

Your rationale should be a polished version of the earlier explanations.

### Audience (Final Submission)
> A complete and polished description of the intended audience(s) for your website.
