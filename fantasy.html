      <h3>The Lord of the Rings</h3>

        <h4>Synopsis</h4>
          <p>
            At 33, the age of adulthood among hobbits, Frodo Baggins receives a magic Ring of Invisibility from his uncle Bilbo. Frodo, a Christlike figure, learns that the ring has the power to control the entire world and, he discovers, to corrupt its owner. A fellowship of hobbits, elves, dwarfs, and men is formed to destroy the ring by casting it into the volcanic fires of the Crack of Doom, where it was forged. They are opposed on their harrowing mission by the evil Sauron and his Black Riders.

            The Lord of the Rings, together with The Hobbit, is considered by many to be the start of the genre known as high fantasy, and these works have had an enormous influence on that genre as a whole.

            John Ronald Reuel Tolkien (1892-1973) was a major scholar of the English language, specialising in Old and Middle English. Twice Professor of Anglo-Saxon (Old English) at the University of Oxford, he also wrote a number of stories, including most famously The Hobbit (1937) and The Lord of the Rings (1954-1955), which are set in a pre-historic era in an invented version of our world which he called by the Middle English name of Middle-earth. This was peopled by Men (and women), Elves, Dwarves, Trolls, Orcs (or Goblins) and of course Hobbits. He has regularly been condemned by the Eng. Lit. establishment, with honourable exceptions, but loved by literally millions of readers worldwide.

            I am a long time fan of the world that the Lord of the Rings takes place in. I have read every peice of Tolkein's legandarium that I could get my hands on, I have probed his letters for any extra lore I could gather, and have analyzed his approach to language creation. Surprisingly, it was after all of this that I finally got around to reading the core of his work: The Lord of the Rings. The story is a classic, and the characters are iconic, but it is Tolkien's world that really stands out. The lore, history, and mythology that he created is so rich and expansive, it truly is a shame he did not officially publish more stories in Middle Earth. A gripe I do have with his writing is that his writing style itself can come off as a bit dry at times making some dialogue sequences difficult to get through. However, this is a minor complaint in the grand scheme of things as this story deserves its place as the cornerstone of the fantasy genre.

            7/10 - the base of the fantasy genre, but the writing style and dialogue are a bit dry

      <h3>The Eye of the World</h3>

        <h4>Synopsis</h4>
          <p>
            The small town of Emond's Field is home to Rand al'Thor, Matrim (Mat) Cauthon, Perrin Aybara, Egwene al'Vere, and Nynaeve al'Meara. The three boys are pursued by Trollocs and Myrddraals (undead commanders leading the Trollocs). Aes Sedai Moiraine Damodred and her Warder Al'Lan Mandragoran, along with gleeman Thom Merrilin and Egwene, flee and try to seek shelter from Ba'alzamon.

            Rand, Mat, and Perry don't fully trust their savior and guide, the Aes Sedai, Moiraine. The Aes Sedai are known to be liars and manipulative. But they have no other choice but to go with Moraine or will put their village in harm's way. As the group makes the journey across the country, they see the world as nobody from their village has ever traveled this far out before.

            The Eye of the World revolves around the three boys from Emond's Field and that has also drawn the attention of Ba'alzamon. Their regular country lives are thrown into chaos and they must flee and fight back against Trollocs as they make their way across the country. Where will this journey lead them and how will the Eye of the World change the world as a result?

          <p>
            Robert Jordan's Eye of the World is an excellent "next step" for the fantasy genre after Tolkein. Robert Jordan takes many of the Tolkienesque tropes and expands on them, while inventing new ones of his own. Many of the characters introduced in this first book are morally grey, with hidden motives that keep the reader questioning their alliegences. The world of The Wheel of Time series is enormous, even compared to Middle Earth, but it seems that occationally, Jordan gets lost in the details of his world. The plot drags on at certain points, especially in the middleof the book, but overall, the world and characters keep the reader interested.

            5/10 - the world and characters are deep and facinating, but the plot drags on for a good portion of the book, and the writer spends too much time on details that don't matter
